above files are used for pre-processing EKG, prepared for respiration rate detection. Can you merge them into 1 file?

This is the code for "longest_consecutive_ones", so you don't need "from xxx.library.tools.noise import longest_consecutive_ones". please update above code. 

please also merge this peak finding function into above code. 

keep generating please

thx. I like following comment style, can you update above code? (while some are missing, can you also add it?)

1-2 sentences generally describe this function

Thanks for merging, and I'd like to name it as 'resp_rate_util.py'. Now I have another 3 python files that may use resp_rate_util.py for resp rate detection. Try to merge 3 python files into 1, using functions in resp_rate_util.py if necessary.
